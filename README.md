# Story time

A place to show you know how to commit and have git configured at home and also in the lab.

# Directions
The goal is to learn the edit/add/commit/push workflow and realize it isn't that bad after some practice.
Make sure all of your commit messsage reflect what step you are doing.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Edit the "story.txt" file in the lab. Push those changes. Do this 3 times so there are 3 commits in the lab. You can fill in words and add new lines. 
3. On your personal device clone the repo.
4. Make an addition to the story.txt file on the git website. There should be this one commit from the web interface, but no more.
5. Pull those changes onto your personal device.
6. Make more changes on your personal device and push them to github. Do this 2 times so there are 2 more commits (6 total commits you made)
7. All of the "madlibs" style placeholders should be replaced when you are done.
