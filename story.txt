Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> 
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about 
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>. It is a way I have of driving off the 
<REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>; 
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>, and bringing up the rear of every <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN>, and methodically 
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> off—then, I account it high time to get to <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> with me.
